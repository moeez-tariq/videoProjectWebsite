## Project Description

Our website is designed to be a one-stop-shop for all things Interactive Media. It offers a comprehensive overview of the Interactive Media program at NYUAD and showcases the incredible work of our students. As the digital world continues to evolve, the need for individuals with expertise in interactive media is increasing. We understand that incoming students and pre-major students may not be fully aware of the breadth and depth of what Interactive Media has to offer, and so we wanted to create a platform that would showcase the exciting and innovative projects that our students are working on. One of the main goals of our website is to demonstrate the versatility of the Interactive Media major. Through the projects displayed on our website, visitors can see how IM combines technical skills with creative problem solving to create engaging and impactful experiences. We hope to inspire and encourage students who may not have considered Interactive Media as a major to explore the possibilities that it offers.

This project explores the final showcase for the Capstone projects of NYUAD's Interactive Media students, taking place inside the 'Black Box' located on Campus in building C3. Essentially, this project explores what it is like as a regular student to experience the wonders of the creativity that IM students have managed to pour into their projects. We introduce the user to the Capstone experience, as well as to the students who managed to create those experiences in the first place. It is a virtual experience, made with the idea that people have the option to experience the showcase through a screen, and have that experience be just as enlightening as an in-person visit.

It is a first-person point-of-view that takes the user through the steps that a regular student in NYUAD will take in order to attend the showcase; starting from waking up in their room, going through their morning routine, to their walk towards and into the Black Box, and finally actually walking around and choosing which of the many projects on display they would like to explore first. The user is allowed to skip certain projects (the 'continue on' button) if they are not interested, or choose to actually experience the project in first person perspective. Finally, once one round was made around the room, the user is allowed to then exit or repeat the tour once again. These decisions come from our website's interactivity with the user while they are going on this journey.

This project is a creative and innovative use of technology to showcase the Capstone projects of NYUAD's Interactive Media students in a virtual environment. The use of a first-person point-of-view provides an immersive experience for the user, making them feel like they are actually attending the showcase in person. The ability to skip certain projects or choose which ones to explore first also adds a level of interactivity to the experience, giving the user more control over their journey.

The project also shows creativity in its approach to storytelling, taking the user through a narrative that starts with waking up in their room and going through their morning routine. This approach adds a personal touch to the experience, making it more relatable to the user and helping to create a stronger emotional connection.


## Process
### Video Shooting Process

For our project, we aimed to go beyond the usual approach and explore creative ways of shooting a video. Initially, we had planned to use a tripod stand for stability and better quality, but we soon realized that this would not be challenging enough. After much discussion, we decided to opt for a Point-of-View (POV) style of shooting that would require us to handle professional camera equipment and learn how to frame our shots effectively.

The video shooting process proved to be the most challenging part of the project, as none of us had prior experience with POV video shooting. To overcome this, we researched extensively and watched multiple tutorials on YouTube to understand how to shoot a good POV video. During our research, we discovered that the more raw and close to real-life the footage is, the better it looks. With this in mind, we decided to apply the advice we had gathered during our research to our shooting process.

We spent around two days trying to come up with the shots that were required. In that planning, we wrote down who needs to be involved, how much to assign to each clip, and what would be said. The actual shooting process took place over a period of three days, due to the need to shoot at different locations, accommodate the availability of everyone involved, and take into account lighting conditions. To give the video a more authentic POV look, we decided to incorporate our hands into the shots while saying “hello” or using a phone. This technique helped to create a more immersive experience for the viewer and make them feel like they were part of the video. We also used a separate microphone for better quality of whatever was being spoken.

The video shooting process was a challenging yet rewarding experience that required us to think outside the box and push ourselves creatively. Despite our lack of prior experience, we were able to produce a high-quality POV video that met the requirements of the project and showcased our ability to take on new challenges.

### Video Editing Process

The video editing process was a time-consuming yet exciting part of our project, which we are proud of. We used Adobe Premiere Pro CC for editing, even though we had no prior experience with video editing. Video editing is a complex process that requires a great deal of attention to detail and patience. Although it was time-consuming, we enjoyed the editing process as it allowed us to experiment with various techniques and bring our creative vision to life. Adobe Premiere Pro CC was a suitable software choice for our project, despite not having prior experience with it. We were able to learn the basics of the software quickly and efficiently with the help of online tutorials.

To start with, we divided the video into smaller clips to fit our website's display preferences. We began by creating a rough cut of the final version without any transitions, effects, or color grading. We made multiple changes until we decided on the final sequence of events. Dividing the video into smaller clips allowed us to organize the footage and make it more manageable. Creating a rough cut helped us to visualize how the final video would look and gave us a foundation to work from. We made multiple changes, experimenting with different sequences of events until we were satisfied with the final result. This iterative process helped us to refine our ideas and produce a polished video.

One of the most challenging tasks was syncing the audio from the microphone. We had to make sure that the audio was perfectly synchronized with the video, which required expanding the waveforms and using markers. After learning from tutorials, we were finally able to sync the audio perfectly. Syncing audio and video is crucial to ensuring that the final product is of high quality. It was a challenging task, as even a second's difference between the audio and video could have ruined the entire video. Expanding the waveforms and using markers made it easier to identify where the audio needed to be synced with the video. Learning from tutorials was incredibly helpful in improving our synchronization skills and achieving a perfectly synced final product.

Once the audio was synced, we added video transition effects such as "cross dissolve" and "dip-to-black" to the appropriate places in the video. To complement the video, we searched for royalty-free music and found a song that fit well. We then adjusted the volume of the music depending on whether someone was speaking or not. Video transitions add visual interest and help to guide the viewer's attention to important moments in the video. "Cross dissolve" and "dip-to-black" are commonly used transitions that can make the video feel more polished and professional. Finding the right music was essential to complementing the video and creating the right mood. Adjusting the volume of the music helped to balance it with the audio from the video and create a seamless audio experience for the viewer.

Finally, we learned how to do color-grading from a mutual, which involved adjusting the brightness and contrast of the video clips to normalize the lighting. After trimming the videos and making necessary adjustments, we exported the final product.

### Website Process

The process of creating the website was a complex one, and we had to consider various factors such as interactivity and design. Our video is based on capstone projects in Black Box, and we designed the website around this concept. We also created a simple yet creative navigation system where a card sliding animation was activated upon hovering over different images on the screen. We drew inspiration for this design element from [Codepen](https://codepen.io/codev_land/pen/yLXeyWX) and edited the code to suit the website's overall style.

One of the most challenging yet best parts of the website was the interactive video that we created. We faced difficulties hosting the video due to its large size. Uploading it to Github or hosting it on Github pages was not possible. We then had the idea to use Vimeo and embed it in our code. However, we wanted to control the video with buttons, which was not possible with the embedded Vimeo code. To solve this, we used Vimeo API to host the video and control it with different buttons. This approach allowed us to control the video and provide users with a more engaging experience.

The video had different buttons that enabled users to perform various actions such as view a project or continue the tour. We used JS to create these buttons and make the video interactive. To get the exact time of the video and perform different actions, we used the "currentTime" variable, which allowed us to provide users with a seamless experience.

We took a creative and innovative approach to creating the website. Despite facing challenges, we worked collaboratively and found solutions to create a functional and visually appealing website. Our design showcased our capstone projects in a black box, and the interactive video added an element of interactivity and engagement. Our success in creating this website was a testament to our hard work, creativity, and ability to overcome challenges.


## Reflection/Evaluation

The initial concept of our project was to explore only one of the Capstone projects and build our theme around the idea of that specific project. After much discussion, we decided that this idea was too narrow in scope and didn't allow for a full representation of the variety of projects being showcased. Therefore, we pivoted to a broader theme that would showcase the overall experience of visiting the Black Box and engaging with the various Capstone projects on display. We wanted to create a virtual experience that would allow visitors to fully immerse themselves in the showcase and get a sense of what each project entailed.

While we are proud of the final product, we encountered several challenges along the way. One of the most difficult aspects of the project was developing the button controls that would allow viewers to skip or play the video. We faced many technical issues, including timer reinitialization and edge cases that took a lot of time to resolve. Filming and editing the video also proved to be a significant challenge, as none of us had extensive experience with the equipment and software. We had to rely heavily on online resources and tutorials to learn the necessary skills. Despite our best efforts, we made a few mistakes along the way, such as not using a gimbal to maintain camera stability during filming or losing 20% of our work because we did not save the project properly.

Despite these challenges, the process of creating this project was a bonding experience for the team. We all learned a lot from each other and were always willing to lend a hand when needed. Our lack of technical expertise was actually an advantage, as we were all on the same learning curve and able to collaborate effectively to achieve our goals. Everyone contributed their unique skills and perspectives to the project, which resulted in a final product that was greater than the sum of its parts.

We are really proud of the final product that we delivered despite all the setbacks and the lack of expertise. The product is exactly what we envisioned. We really learned a lot on the way and we are sure that these skills would beneficial to us in the future.
